# Contracts
## Audit
Please find the [audit](https://omniscia.io/wallfair-token-vesting/) of the `WFAIRToken` and `TokenLock` contracts done by [Omniscia](https://omniscia.io/) 
## WFAIRToken
The `WFAIRToken` is an ERC20 token that uses ERC1363 extentions. The ERC20 implementation is provided by OpenZeppelin, and ERC1363 extensions are by https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token.

When a `transfer` method is used, the extensions allow the token to inform the receiver whether it is a smart contract on transfer, which provides similar functionality to the fallback function in the case of native ETH.

Extensions are intendend to be used within Wallfair Platform, that is, to stake tokens in the PLP contract without the need of an additional `approve` transaction.

The `WFAIRToken` contract immediately mints the requested supply to the `msg.sender`. For what happens after that see the *Deployment* section.

## TokenLock 
`TokenLock` implements simple vesting schedule. Within the contract we define a *vesting function* which, for a given total amount of tokens, tells how many of the tokens may be released at a given moment. This function is defined as follows:

1. It releases tokens linearly, proportional to the time elapsed from the *vesting start* timestamp. Effectively, it releases tokens block by block
2. It realeases tokens fully after the *vesting period* has elapsed, as measured from the *vesting start*.
3. A *cliff period* may be defined, which works as a standard vesting cliff. See https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/what-is-cliff-vesting.asp
4. An *initial release fraction* may be defined, which will release that fraction of the tokens immediately on *vesting start*

`TokenLock` fulfills several implementation requirements:

1. Only one vesting function may be defined per contract instance.
2. Tokens belonging to several addresses may be locked in single instance provided they have the same vesting schedule. Addresses may be simple addresses, or they can be contracts
3. A cliff and an initial release may not be defined together in single instance
4. *vesting start* may be specified to have happened in the past, or in the future in reference to the time of the deployment of the contract
5. The contract can be requested to execute a `transfer` function to the address defined as the owner, and it keeps track of how much was already released. The actual release therefore happens via an owner-executed transaction. The release will fail if the `TokenLock` does not held enough WFAIR tokens.
6. There are no methods to "reclaim" non-released tokens. Tokens that can't be released (if the owner lost the private key, for example) are locked forever.
7. All time periods must be multiples of 30 days.
8. A list of stakes (*owner address : total amount due* mapping) is provided at the deployment time, and cannot be changed later.

### Funding the Lock with tokens
`TokenLock` requires that the total amount of tokens passed to the constructor is owned by it, before the release function is available. For that a simple state machine is implemented:

1. The contract is in an `Initialized` state after deploymend, until the `fund` method is called
2. After `funded` method successfully completes, the state is changed to `Funded` and the `release` function is available to be called.

The actual funding may happen in three ways:

1. The required amount of tokens is transferred to the `TokenLock` instance before `fund` method is called. In that case the method just verifies the instance balance, and performs the state transition
2. The required amount of tokens is approved as per ERC20 to the `TokenLock` instance before `fund` method is called. In that case the contract will transfer the required amount to itself from the sender (msg.sender).
3. A mix of the above: only the amount missing will be required to be approved and later transferred.

The actual deployment requires several instances of the `TokenLock` to be created to cover all the vesting schedules Wallfair needs.

## LeaverTokenLock
`LeaverTokenLock` implements a lock that defines two events that lead to slashing the stake of particular wallet. Those events are called `bad leaver` and `good leaver` and indicate that given wallet holder left the project and must give up on part of his/her tokens. `LeaverTokenLock` will be used for Team token allocation. Below are basic implementation requirements, we also provide simulations of vesting schedules [here](sims/vesting.html)).

1. `LeaverTokenLock` inherits from `TokenLock` and does change its behavior if events above are not triggered.
2. Manager role is added. Only that role can trigger the leaver event for any wallet (except the manager itself). Manager can also hold own stake and on production deployment will be a mutlisig.
3. The tokens slashed from wallet that left are booked to manager wallet. The total number of tokens that will be released from the lock is invariant.

The amount of slashed tokens are computed as follows.

1. The original mechanism of vesting is not changed - tokens are released from *vesting start* and goes on for *vesting priod*. However we introduce another mechanism that starts one *vesting period* before *vesting start* called `accumulation` (see [simulations](sims/vesting.html)).
2. The team token lock starts vesting tokens after 12 months of delay. Accumulation then effectively begins on the day of TGE. Accumulation is decoupled for actual token release with `release` function.

### Good Leaver

* Keeps all the tokens accumulated until the event date.
* Keeps half (1/2) of the tokens that would be accumulated from the event date until the end of vesting period.
* Further vesting (unlocking) of the tokens proceeds unchanged but with the modified total stake for the wallet

### Bad Leaver

* Before the *vesting start* - keeps 10% (1/10) of the tokens accumulated until the event date.
* After the *vesting start* - keeps 10% (1/10) of the tokens accumulated until the event date or the amount of tokens that were vested - whichever is higher. The reason for that is that vested tokens cannot be taken back as they were released from the contract.
* Has no title to any tokens accumulated after event date.

### Transfering stake
Manager can transfer stake that s/he will eventually unlock to existing or a new wallet. That allows to (1) redistribute reposesed tokens from leaver events (2) give additional bonuses to existing or new team members. The amount of tokens available for transfer is a total amount that may be unlocked until the end of vesting period. For more details see `lockAmount` function and tests.

## Deployment
The deployment procedure is as follows:
1. `WFAIRToken` instance is deployed and the full supply is minted to `msg.sender` (`deployer`).
2. Several `TokenLock` instances are deployed, depending on the actual allocations and vesting schedules of Wallfair, and final lists of addresses are provided to those instances.
3. The `deployer` transfers the tokens it holds to the `TokenLock` instances (and other wallets if needed) - as per the Wallfair token allocation. At this point `deployer` will not hold any tokens and its private key may be destroyed.

# Installation

Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/wallfair-organization/WFAIR-Token.git`

Ensure you have node.js and npm installed. You must be using **npm version >= 7**.

Then install the required packages for the Hardhat toolchain:

`npm install`

Next, try compiling the contracts to see if it has all worked:

`npx hardhat compile`

# Testing
We use the `Truffle` plugin to write tests. Tests can be run using:

`npm run test`

# Linting
We use `solhint` and `eslint` for linting. Relevant commands are `npm run lint`, `npm run lint:sol` and `npm run lint:js`.

# Coverage
We use solidity-coverage with `npm run hardhat:coverage`.

# Network configuration

## For local development 
Create an empty `.env` file with `touch .env`.

By default `hardhat.config.js` is used when executing Hardhat commands. It is configured to only
support the in-memory or local standalone network. If no network is specified, the in-memory 
network is used by default.

You can start a local standalone network with `npx hardhat node` and then run Hardhat commands 
on it with the network option `--network localhost`.

## For remote network deployment

For full deployment, you will need to correctly configure an `.env` file. See `.env.example` for the format.

Then run your Hardhat commands using the `config` option:

`npx hardhat <COMMAND> --config hardhat-deploy.config.js --network <NETWORK>`

Remember to be careful with your keys! Share your keys and you share your coins.
